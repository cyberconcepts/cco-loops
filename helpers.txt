loops - Linked Objects for Organization and Processing Services
===============================================================

This file documents and tests a bunch of facilities that support the
loops framework, mostly provided by sub-packages of the cybertools
package.

  ($Id$)

Let's first do some basic imports

  >>> from zope.app.testing.setup import placefulSetUp, placefulTearDown
  >>> site = placefulSetUp(True)
  
  >>> from zope.app import zapi
  >>> from zope.app.tests import ztapi
  >>> from zope.interface import Interface
  >>> from zope.publisher.browser import TestRequest

and setup a simple loops site with its manager objects,
  
  >>> from loops import Loops
  >>> site['loops'] = Loops()
  >>> loopsRoot = site['loops']

  >>> from loops.concept import ConceptManager, Concept
  >>> loopsRoot['concepts'] = ConceptManager()
  >>> concepts = loopsRoot['concepts']

  >>> from loops.resource import ResourceManager, Document, MediaAsset
  >>> loopsRoot['resources'] = ResourceManager()
  >>> resources = loopsRoot['resources']

some concepts,
  
  >>> cc1 = Concept(u'Zope')
  >>> concepts['cc1'] = cc1
  >>> cc1.title
  u'Zope'

  >>> cc2 = Concept(u'Zope 3')
  >>> concepts['cc2'] = cc2
  >>> cc2.title
  u'Zope 3'

and resources:

  >>> doc1 = Document(u'Zope Info')
  >>> resources['doc1'] = doc1
  >>> doc1.title
  u'Zope Info'

  >>> img1 = MediaAsset(u'An Image')
  >>> resources['img1'] = img1

Finally, we also need a relation registry:

  >>> from cybertools.relation.interfaces import IRelationRegistry
  >>> from cybertools.relation.registry import DummyRelationRegistry
  >>> from zope.app.testing import ztapi
  >>> ztapi.provideUtility(IRelationRegistry, DummyRelationRegistry())

Type management with typology
=============================

The type of an object may be determined by adapting it to the IType
interface. The loops framework provides an adapter (LoopsType) for this
purpose:

  >>> from cybertools.typology.interfaces import IType
  >>> from loops.interfaces import IConcept
  >>> from loops.type import ConceptType
  >>> ztapi.provideAdapter(IConcept, IType, ConceptType)
  >>> cc1_type = IType(cc1)

As we have not yet associated a type with one of our content objects we get

  >>> cc1_type.typeProvider is None
  True
  >>> cc1_type.title
  u'Unknown Type'
  >>> cc1_type.token
  '.unknown'

So we create two special concepts: one ('hasType') as the predicate signifying
a type relation, and the other ('type') as the one and only type concept:

  >>> concepts['hasType'] = Concept(u'has type')
  >>> concepts['type'] = Concept(u'Type')
  >>> typeObject = concepts['type']

Assigning a type to a concept is a core functionality of concepts as
concept types are themselves concepts; and we assign the type object to
itself (as it in fact is of type 'type'):

  >>> typeObject.conceptType = typeObject

So let's check the type of the type object:

  >>> type_type = IType(typeObject)
  >>> type_type.typeProvider is typeObject
  True
  >>> type_type.title
  u'Type'
  >>> type_type.token
  '.loops/concepts/type'
  >>> type_type.tokenForSearch
  'loops:concept:type'

Now we register another type ('topic') and assign it to cc1:

  >>> concepts['topic'] = Concept(u'Topic')
  >>> topic = concepts['topic']
  >>> topic.conceptType = typeObject
  >>> cc1.conceptType = topic

Note: as these kind of usually short-living adapters makes heavy use of
lazy properties, one should always get a new adapter:

  >>> topic_type = IType(topic)
  >>> cc1_type = IType(cc1)
  >>> topic_type == type_type
  True
  >>> cc1_type == topic_type
  False
  >>> cc1_type.typeProvider == topic
  True

Now let's have a look at resources.

  >>> from loops.interfaces import IResource
  >>> from loops.type import ResourceType
  >>> ztapi.provideAdapter(IResource, IType, ResourceType)

  >>> doc1_type = IType(doc1)
  >>> doc1_type.title
  u'Document'
  >>> doc1_type.token
  '.loops/resources/document'
  >>> doc1_type.tokenForSearch
  'loops:resource:document'
  
  >>> img1_type = IType(img1)
  >>> img1_type.title
  u'Media Asset'

Can we find out somehow which types are available? This is the time to look
for a type manager. This could be a utility; but in the loops package it
is again an adapter, now for the loops root object. Nevertheless one can
get a type manager from all loops objects, always with the same context:

  >>> from cybertools.typology.interfaces import ITypeManager
  >>> from loops.interfaces import ILoopsObject
  >>> from loops.type import LoopsTypeManager
  >>> ztapi.provideAdapter(ILoopsObject, ITypeManager, LoopsTypeManager)
  >>> typeManager = ITypeManager(loopsRoot)
  >>> typeManager.context == ITypeManager(cc1).context == loopsRoot
  True

  >>> types = typeManager.types
  >>> sorted(t.token for t in types)
  ['.loops/concepts/topic', '.loops/concepts/type',
   '.loops/resources/document', '.loops/resources/mediaasset']

  >>> typeManager.getType('.loops/concepts/topic') == cc1_type
  True

Index attributes adapter
------------------------

  >>> from loops.concept import IndexAttributes
  >>> idx = IndexAttributes(cc2)
  >>> idx.type()
  'loops:concept:unknown'
  
  >>> from loops.resource import IndexAttributes
  >>> idx = IndexAttributes(doc1)
  >>> idx.type()
  'loops:resource:Document'
