New features

- full-text indexing for OpenOffice (ODF) documents (text, spreadsheet, presentation)
- tracking reports: overview; recent changes
- basic job management: a job executor view calls job managers specified
  by loops root option ``organize.job.managers``
- allow ``__getitem__`` on Loops and ViewManager, this is a prerequisite for
  using virtual hosts over more than one path element (e.g. leading to
  views/home) on protected sites; this also allows calling of (public)
  job processiong views via wget without login credentials
- add definition of loops package version (see loops/version.py)

Bug fixes

- use select version on file, image and media asset links
  (via ``?version=this`` in the URL)
